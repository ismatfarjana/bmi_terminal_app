## About the Project

Body mass index, or **BMI**, is used to determine whether you are in a healthy weight range for your height.

## What’s BMI?

BMI compares your weight to your height, and is calculated by dividing your weight (in kilograms) by your height (in metres squared). It gives you an idea of whether you’re 'underweight', a 'healthy' weight, 'overweight', or 'obese' for your height. BMI is one type of tool to help health professionals assess the risk for chronic disease.
